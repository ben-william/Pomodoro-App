# Pomodoro App
Simple Timer App built using Tkinter

```
Note: I am aware this project could use considerable refactoring to make it more robust, implement OOP, etc. 
This was a training exercise uploaded as-is.
I am currently focused on exploring new concepts rather than perfecting what currently exists. 
```

## Features

* Shows a timer that counts down from 25 min after clicking "Start Timer"
* Starts a 5min timer after the 25min working time hits 00:00
* Every 4 work periods - starts a 20min long break timer
* Shows emoji checkmarks to track number of completed working pomodoros
